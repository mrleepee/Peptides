  "id": "ss31",
  "name": "SS-31",
  "type": "Mitochondrial-targeting Tetrapeptide",
  "category": "Longevity & Mitochondrial Health",
  "mechanism": "Selective mitochondrial targeting via alternating aromatic-cationic residues. Binds to cardiolipin in inner mitochondrial membrane, stabilizing cristae structure and improving electron transport chain efficiency. Reduces mitochondrial ROS production and inhibits mPTP opening",
  "half_life": "~2-4 hours (subcutaneous)",
  "dosing": "Research doses typically 1-10mg daily via subcutaneous injection",
  "administration": "Subcutaneous or intravenous",
  "primary_benefits": [
    "Enhances mitochondrial ATP production",
    "Reduces oxidative stress and ROS",
    "Cardioprotection (ischemia-reperfusion injury)",
    "Neuroprotection",
    "Improves muscle function and exercise capacity",
    "Potential anti-aging effects"
  ],
  "research_findings": "Developed as elamipretide (also known as SS-31 or Bendavia). Phase 2/3 trials for mitochondrial myopathy, primary mitochondrial diseases, and age-related conditions. Shows promise for heart failure, macular degeneration, and neurodegenerative diseases. Improves mitochondrial efficiency and reduces oxidative damage",
