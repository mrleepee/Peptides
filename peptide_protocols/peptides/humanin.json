  "research_findings": "Discovered in 2001 during screen for proteins that protect against Alzheimer's-related neuronal death. Humanin levels decline with age. Acts as a cytoprotective factor across multiple cell types. Research shows protection against A-beta toxicity, myocardial ischemia, and other age-related pathologies. May be a key longevity peptide",
