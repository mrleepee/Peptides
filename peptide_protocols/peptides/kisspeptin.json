  "dosing": "Research doses vary, typically 10-100mcg via injection or nasal",
  "administration": "Subcutaneous, intravenous, or intranasal",
  "primary_benefits": [
    "Regulates reproductive hormone production",
    "May improve libido and sexual function",
    "Metabolic regulation effects",
    "Potential cancer suppression properties (KISS1 metastasis suppressor)",
    "Modulates puberty and fertility"
  ],
  "research_findings": "Discovered as metastasis suppressor gene product. Critical for puberty initiation and reproductive function. Research ongoing for hypogonadism treatment, infertility, and potential anti-cancer applications. May have roles in energy balance and metabolism",
