  "name": "Mod GRF 1-29 (CJC-1295 no DAC)",
  "type": "GHRH Analogue",
  "category": "Growth Hormone",
  "mechanism": "Modified GHRH (1-29) that stimulates pulsatile GH release without drug affinity complex (DAC). Provides natural GH pulse pattern",
  "half_life": "~30 minutes",
  "dosing": "100-200mcg, 2-3x daily",
  "administration": "Subcutaneous injection",
  "primary_benefits": [
    "Stimulates natural GH release patterns",
    "No DAC means more physiological pulsing",
    "Synergistic with Ipamorelin",
    "Body composition improvement",
    "Visceral fat reduction",
    "Alternative to Tesamorelin"
  ],
  "research_findings": "Modified growth hormone releasing hormone without the drug affinity complex. Provides more natural pulsatile GH release than CJC-1295 with DAC. Often stacked with Ipamorelin for enhanced GH output",
  "system_targets": [
    "Endocrine",
    "Metabolic"
  ],
  "accessibility": "Research peptide, widely available",
  "cost_tier": "medium",
  "ordered": true,
  "special_notes": "Best alternative to Tesamorelin when paired with Ipamorelin. The 'no DAC' version allows natural pulsing vs continuous elevation",
  "order_status": "Ordered and received"
