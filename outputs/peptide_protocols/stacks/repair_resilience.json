    "Tissue repair acceleration",
    "Injury recovery",

  "mechanism": "BPC-157 promotes angiogenesis and tissue-specific repair while TB-500 enhances cell migration and reduces systemic inflammation. Combined, they address both local injury and systemic recovery.",
  "protocol": {
    "bpc157": {
      "dose": "250-500mcg",
      "frequency": "1-2x daily",
      "administration": "Subcutaneous or oral (oral for gut issues)",
      "timing": "Morning and/or evening"
    },
    "tb500": {
      "dose": "2-5mg",
      "frequency": "1-2x weekly",
      "administration": "Subcutaneous or intramuscular",
      "timing": "Flexible"
    }
  },
  "cycling": "Acute injuries: 4-6 weeks. Chronic issues: 8-12 weeks with breaks",
  "synergy_notes": "BPC-157's angiogenic and repair signaling complements TB-500's systemic anti-inflammatory and cell migration effects",
  "considerations": [
    "Can inject near injury site or systemically",
    "BPC-157 oral administration effective for gut issues",
    "Generally very well tolerated"
  ],
  "special_applications": {
    "sibo_gut_health": "BPC-157 oral 250-500mcg 2x daily for direct gut repair",
    "acute_injury": "Increase frequency, inject near injury if possible",
    "chronic_inflammation": "Focus on TB-500 for systemic effects",
    "with_kpv": "Add KPV 500-1000mcg daily for enhanced anti-inflammatory effects, especially for gut-focused healing"
