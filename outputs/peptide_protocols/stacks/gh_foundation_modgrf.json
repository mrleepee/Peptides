  "mechanism": "Mod GRF 1-29 (GHRH analogue without DAC) + Ipamorelin (GHS) creates synergistic GH release with natural pulsing. Similar to Tesamorelin+Ipamorelin but with shorter half-life GHRH component",
  "protocol": {
    "modgrf129": {
      "dose": "100-200mcg",
      "frequency": "2-3x daily",
      "timing": "Morning, post-workout, before bed",

      "dose": "100-300mcg",

  "cycling": "Can run continuously or cycle 5 days on, 2 days off",
  "synergy_notes": "The combination creates physiological GH pulses. Mod GRF provides GHRH signal while Ipamorelin amplifies release via ghrelin pathway. No DAC means natural pulsing vs continuous elevation",
  "considerations": [
    "Dose together for maximum synergy",
    "More frequent dosing than Tesamorelin (due to shorter half-life)",
    "Cost-effective alternative to Tesamorelin",
