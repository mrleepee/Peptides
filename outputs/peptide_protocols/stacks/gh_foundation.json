  "mechanism": "GHRH + GHS creates synergistic GH release. Tesamorelin provides the 'signal' while Ipamorelin amplifies the 'release'. Research suggests the combination produces 3-5x greater GH output than either alone.",

    "tesamorelin": {
      "dose": "1-2mg daily",
      "timing": "Before bed",
      "administration": "Subcutaneous"

      "dose": "100-300mcg",

  "synergy_notes": "The combination of GHRH analog (Tesamorelin) and GHS (Ipamorelin) creates a more physiological GH pulse than either alone",
  "considerations": [
    "Monitor fasting glucose",
