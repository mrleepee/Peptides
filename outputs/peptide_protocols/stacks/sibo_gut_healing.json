  "mechanism": "BPC-157 repairs gut mucosa and modulates motility while KPV provides targeted anti-inflammatory signaling via NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathway modulation. Both can be taken orally for direct gut targeting",
  "protocol": {
    "bpc157": {
      "dose": "250-500mcg",
      "frequency": "2x daily",
      "administration": "Oral (for gut focus)",

      "dose": "500-1000mcg",

  "cycling": "Run for 4-8 weeks for gut healing, can extend if needed",
  "synergy_notes": "BPC-157 handles structural repair and motility while KPV specifically targets inflammatory signaling. The combination addresses both repair and inflammation aspects of SIBO and gut issues",
  "considerations": [
    "Oral administration allows direct gut tissue contact",
    "Both transported via intestinal peptide transporters",
    "May combine with antimicrobial SIBO protocols",
    "Generally very well tolerated"
