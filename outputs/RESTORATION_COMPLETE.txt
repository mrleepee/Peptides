================================================================================
Date: 2026-02-02
Status: SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED
File: /sessions/stoic-youthful-darwin/mnt/Peptides/outputs/peptide-protocols-app.html

================================================================================
TASKS COMPLETED
================================================================================

1. EXTRACTED 4 MISSING PEPTIDES
   ✓ Pancragen (Metabolic & Endocrine) - DISCUSSED
   ✓ Cortagen (Cognitive Enhancement) - DISCUSSED
   ✓ Chonluten (Digestive Health) - DISCUSSED
   ✓ Livagen (Metabolic & Liver Health) - DISCUSSED

2. FIXED EPITALON STATUS
   ✓ Updated from uncertain to "ordered: true"
   ✓ Verified against peptide_orders.csv (Reference 5)

3. ADDED ARTICLES_DATA SECTION
   ✓ Extracted complete scientific articles structure
   ✓ Includes: BPC-157, MOTS-c, AOD-9604, DSIP
   ✓ Each article contains:
     - Executive summary
     - Detailed mechanisms with protein links
     - Research highlights
     - Clinical applications
     - Safety considerations
     - References with URLs

4. INTEGRATED SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES VIEW
   ✓ Added "Scientific Deep Dive" section to peptide detail view
   ✓ Displays article data when available
   ✓ Shows mechanisms, applications, safety info
   ✓ Links to research references and protein databases

5. VERIFIED HEROICONS
   ✓ Heroicons loaded from Tailwind CDN
   ✓ Icons properly used throughout UI
   ✓ Navigation, badges, and section headers working
