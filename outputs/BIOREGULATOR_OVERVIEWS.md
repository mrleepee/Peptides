# BioLongevity Labs Bioregulator Peptides - Quick Overviews

## What Are Bioregulators?

Bioregulators (also called cytomaxes or cytogens) are short-chain peptides developed by Professor Vladimir Khavinson in Russia. They're organ-specific peptides that help restore cellular function in their target tissues. The theory is that they work via epigenetic regulation - influencing gene expression in specific organs.

**Common characteristics:**
- Russian/Soviet research tradition (St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation)
- Typically 2-4 amino acids
- Organ/tissue-specific
- Cyclic dosing (10-20 days on, then off)
- Can be oral or injectable
- Generally very safe with minimal side effects
