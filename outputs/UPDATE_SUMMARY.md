# Update Summary - Peptide Protocols App

## ✅ What Was Fixed

You were absolutely right - the original app was missing peptides that were discussed in your conversation and didn't distinguish between what you ordered vs what was just discussed.

## 🆕 What's New

### Added Missing Peptides (2)
1. **KPV** - Anti-inflammatory tripeptide for SIBO and gut health
   - Mentioned 36 times in conversation
   - ✅ In your orders

2. **Mod GRF 1-29 (CJC-1295 no DAC)** - GHRH analogue
   - Mentioned 28 times in conversation
   - ✅ In your orders
   - Alternative to Tesamorelin for GH optimization

### New Peptide Status System
Every peptide now shows whether it was:
- **📦 ORDERED** (11 peptides) - Green badges, green borders
- **💭 DISCUSSED ONLY** (3 peptides) - Purple badges, purple borders

### Added New Stacks (2)
1. **Growth Hormone Foundation Stack (Ordered Alternative)**
   - Mod GRF 1-29 + Ipamorelin
   - Uses the peptides you actually ordered

2. **SIBO & Gut Healing Stack (Ordered)**
   - BPC-157 + KPV
   - Both peptides you ordered
   - Specific protocol for gut health
